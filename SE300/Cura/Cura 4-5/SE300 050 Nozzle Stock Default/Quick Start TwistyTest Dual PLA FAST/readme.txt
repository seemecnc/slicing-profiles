Twisty is just a 120mm/s test print for dual extrusion. 

Layers 0.24mm thick. 
Nozzle 0.5mm dia. (SeeMeCNC standard nozzle size since 2011)

"FAST" means there will be lower quality results, but a quick print. Probably
 still mechanically usable, but FAST printing means LOWER quality. 

Temps will probably need to be even a little hotter. The 220C temps allow the 
 hotend to melt the PLA fast enough to extrude at the fast speed.
