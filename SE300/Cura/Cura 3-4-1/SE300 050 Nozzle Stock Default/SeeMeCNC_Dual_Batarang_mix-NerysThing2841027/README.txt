SeeMeBatArang is based on opensource sharealike thingiverse
2841027. Check it out!

The SeeMeCNC SeeMeBatArang is likewise opensource sharealike 
licensed, so give us some credit if you use our remix for
something as well. :)

The file with extension  .curaproject.3mf  will load a 
machine profile called "Dual Extrusion 050 Nozzle" and
create a slicing profile 
"SE300 PLA Dual Default Blinky-bat-a-rang". Use this 
as an example to quickly start with SeeMeCNC Dual extrusion. 

Notes: 

1. Setup for all stock OEM SeeMeCNC parts. Geared extruders
	will not usually spin fast enough to retract some filament
	without stringing. A quick reverse pull is essential to 
	avoid stringing during filament changeover, which can lead
	to jams in the Y adapter. 
	
2.	The SeeMeBatArang must be grouped.  Hold 'shift' and select
	the outter and inner STL's.  Right click and choose 'group'. 
	Do not choose 'merge'.  We find misalignment can happen when
	using 'merge'.   So use 'group' from the right click menu
	when your mouse is hovered over the workspace in Cura. 
	
3. 	Filament start position. BOTH FILAMENTS start approximately 
	40mm above the push to connect fittings of our Y adapter.  
	This is true for RostockMAX v3.2 and Artemis and BOSSdelta's.
