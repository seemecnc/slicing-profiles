=================== XST SE300 Hotend Assembly  ================


XST SE300 Cura slicing profiles have been tested on BOSSdelta	
	model 0505 printers. 
	

XST (Xstruder) hotend is designed to better melt the filament and 
  extrude at a lower, more accurate, melting temperature than the 
  regular SE300 hotend assembly.
  

Notes: 
1. The XST SE300 is nearly identical to the SE300 except:
	a) XST has a larger heater block
	b) XST has a longer nozzle to improve the melt and flow
	
2. initial release first quarter 2019 with EZR Cold End drive
	a) XST SE300 ships with all BOSSdelta printers
	


	
=================== Cura 3.4.1 / Cura 3.5.1 Specifically  ==================

The standard XST SE300 default profiles also work with XST heater 
	blocks and XST nozzles adapted to Artemis SE300 hotends. 
	
Check all settings after importing our standard tested profiles.
